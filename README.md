# HR Management System - Student Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a student who developed this HR Management System as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course. This project demonstrates the practical application of OOP concepts in building a real-world application.

## About the Project

This is a simple yet functional HR Management System that I built using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles. It's perfect for students who want to:
- Learn how to build a complete Java application
- Understand database integration with Java
- Practice OOP concepts in a real project
- See how to create a user interface using Swing

## Features I Implemented

- Employee Information Management
- Attendance Tracking
- Database Integration (MS Access)
- User-friendly Interface
- Secure Data Management

## Technologies I Used

- Java
- MS Access Database
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Swing GUI Framework
